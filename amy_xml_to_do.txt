TO Do:

    ask user for file location
    use glob to locate files within the folder
    if 1 file -> run checks and parser
    if >1 file loop through and generate a dictionary K, V = {LRG ID, Gene symbol}
    ask user to specify gene symbol - convert to UPPER
    locate file than call get data function for that specific function 

Limitations:
	canâ€™t glob files in downloads folder
	does not take into consideration differences between genome builds

Documents to include:
	example of file out put
	readme file
	list test files
	document testing criteria
